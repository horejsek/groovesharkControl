With Grooveshark Control you can control Grooveshark from everywhere. Almost from everywhere. :)

If you have some issue or you want some new feature, please feel free to let me know on GitHub. Thanks. https://github.com/horejsek/groovesharkControl

This extension is not official extension from Grooveshark developers.

 * Player control
 * Volume control
 * Song control
 * Now playing song
 * Now playing queue
 * Radio
 * Icon status
 * Notification
 * Search in address bar (type GC)
 * Search in context menu
 * Shortcut (press pause/break)
 * And a lot of more

Explanations of needed rights:
 * tabs: Extension need to communicate with Grooveshark page and extension close notification when you close tab with Grooveshark.
 * context menu: Well, that's obvious. On every page you have possibility to search selected text in Grooveshark by clicking in context menu.
 * notification: That's obivous as well.
 * access to grooveshark.com: Extension needs to communicate with Grooveshark page, so it needs permission to add some code to the page.
 * access to every page: Extension supports shortcuts (only Pause/break for play/pause for now) and for that it needs add code which listen when you press some shortcut to every page.
